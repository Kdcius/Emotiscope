I'm attempting to port the Emotiscope firmware away from Arduino/PlatformIO directly to IDF in hopes of solving [#106](https://github.com/Lixie-Labs/Emotiscope/issues/106) and gaining an even deeper control of the ESP32-S3 on-board.

(I'm also re-writing the app in the Godot Engine instead of raw HTML/JS! Stay tuned ‚ù§)
